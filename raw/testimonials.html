      <h3>Find out what a few of our customers had to say!</h3>
      <p class="style1">    &quot;It has been a pleasure doing business with the Countertop Shop. My wife and I are very happy with the design, workmanship and knowledge that the whole staff of employees possess.</p>
      <p><em>All of their hard work far exceeded our expectations and we smile each time we enter our bathrooms and kitchen. If we would ever plan another remodel we would definitely use the Countertop Shop again.<br>
  Thank you Countertop Shop for a job well done</em>.&quot;  - Carter Family</p>
      <p><em>&quot; When considering a kitchen makeover, I immediately knew that my first stop would be The Countertop Shoppe.  I had worked with Steve Deford years ago with a minor kitchen upgrade and was very pleased with his skill and willingness to do what I wanted. My husband and I met with Steve Deford to discuss the project which included flipping my dining room with my kitchen, opening up a wall into the living room and creating a brand new kitchen and dining room from top to bottom.  Taking our input and adding his own creative touches, Steve designed the kitchen of my dreams on paper and we knew that we didn't need to shop any further for our kitchen makeover.  We knew that we wanted The Countertop Shoppe to take care of this once in a lifetime (for us) project.  Mike and John Boener were the main craftsmen that completed the project.  The personal care and attention to detail that they offered cannot be measured in dollars.  They truly approached our project with the type of care that a carpenter gives his own home. Through the process, we gained some special friends as they are such a joy to work with.  We absolutely love our new kitchen and the way that it has opened up our home to be even more inviting for family and friends.  The Countertop Shoppe is definitely the place to go for your personal or business projects. The Delp family highly recommends them!&quot;</em></p>
      <p><em>&quot;With our experience owning a construction company, we found that your attention to detail is exceptional.  We truly appreciate your creativity, care and craftsmanship.  The quality of your work shines through and we know this kitchen remodel will prove to be a great investment to us for years to come.&quot;</em>  -Wendel Family</p>
      <p><em>&quot;When we decided to remodel our kitchen, it was a decision that had been several years coming.  After seeing two kitchens that the Countertop Shoppe had done, I felt they were able to meet our expectations.  I was correct. They met and exceeded our standards for quality of work.  I had several unique requests for my kitchen and Steve and Mike were great at working with me on these.  We have an old home and they did a terrific job designing a kitchen and cabinets that fit the Victorian style of our home.  I greatly appreciated their attention to detail.  As I observed their work, they did not cut corners.  They took the extra time and effort to do things in the best way possible.  If I would be asked for one comment about their work, it would be their precision and attention to detail. Many of these details were not apparent to the eye, but very important to the quality of the job and the structural integrity of our home. I love my new kitchen!!</em>&quot; - Umbaugh Family</p>
